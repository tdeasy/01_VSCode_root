Hey Ines, here's a few portfolio references I pulled together - you'll have to use your imagination a bit as the actual 
people whome represent these portfolio's are all obviously highlighting their talents in all sorts of different 
careers. But I think you'l find there's a certain simplicity to each of their messages and they're all
able to represent whatever it is they do in a approachable way that makes you somewhat keen to maybe reach out 
and work with them. I also tried to mix in a variety of site-design aesthetics just to get a sense of what You
gravitate towards.

I also though this site might interest you - as you start thinking of yourself as more of a brand that you're 
trying to put  out there in the world, I sometimes find it helpful to see how succesful regular brands went about
defining themselves. There's alot more similarity between the personal branding and commercial branding than
what may appear at first. One thing you'll notice in the site's above, and the case-studies regarding the brands 
in the link below is that there's this subtle feeling ofc onsistency in everything you're interacting with them. 
From tone of voice, to how they choose to post content etc, it all just has this subtle feeling that becomes recognizable
and comfortable - and ultimantly that's what succesful brands - personal or public do best. You define yourself, what 
you want to do, what you've done, what you believe in, and then use that as the framework for how/why you're doing 
whatever you're looking to do next. It's a storyline in a way, and one that stays consistent.

Lastly I also wanted to include one of the best resources to find sites like these 
is a site https://www.siteinspire.com/ 

For the last 15+ year's they've been posting 2-3 sites a day that feature great
content and design. They've index literally 1000's of great websites and then categorized them based on s
subject / content, so you can also just just browsing around using the different filters at the top
and see what stands out to you. 

Lastly, as far as getting your domain setup - I honestly think you should just get both names, since IG 
is your main platform to connect out to I'd go with taziines.com as the domain I use to build whatever kind of 
website and content we land on, but also having the other domain, i.e inestazi.com just makes sense from 
a technical standpoint because of how google works in connecting search results to people. I'll spare you the
complicated back-end stuff but bassically having your full name as a website that Google can index, it will 
automatically draw the connection to your taziines.com website so that when someone Googles you your website and 
related articles and content from other brands and sources will all appear higher up in the search results. 

The total cost of buying both domain names is like $24. or $12/year x 2. 

I hope all this info dump helps in some way. Ultimantly you're talented, people know you, you know
what you want and who you are - so putting those pieces togeher in a simple website will be easier than it sounds.
Trust me - I hate writing about myself but my portfolio is literally the only way I get hired, and 
it all came together once I just started writing about what I do in my own voice and not over thinking it. 
I guess that's the best advice I can give at this point.

Anyways, I'm flying to New York tonight to meet with Alex Harrow - the long-time friend and occasional business partner 
I've mentioned that I want to connect you with. I'll have a better idea of when that'll happen once 
we meet up in the city tommorow so I'll keep you posted. The managment company he co-leads is called Milk & Honey.
The timing of all this is pretty fortuitious as they're currently a managment company primarly focused in music, sports 
and venture capatalism, but he's recently started to push to begin building a roster of talent that is basically you 
in a nutshell. So not alot of downside to chatting with him. 

Hee's a bit of background on him for reference as well:
